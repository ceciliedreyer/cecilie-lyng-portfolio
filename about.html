            I build things for the web. As an experienced entrepreneur,
            strategic thinker and front-end developer, I can help your start-up
            idea come to life or help you get your business to the next level.

          <p class="bio-paragraph">
            Welcome to my portfolio! I am a frontend developer with a strong
            foundation in HTML, CSS, and React.js, complemented by extensive
            experience in product management and entrepreneurship. I approach
            each project by first understanding the business objectives, then
            coordinating closely with planning and design teams to ensure the
            final product aligns with the overall strategy. <br /><br />
            With a background that includes founding and managing my own
            music-tech business, where I built a platform in collaboration with
            a London-based software agency, and working as a Product Manager at
            a music-tech scale-up, I have honed my skills in developing and
            launching innovative products. My entrepreneurial journey has
            equipped me with a strategic mindset, enabling me to raise pre-seed
            investments and pivot business models effectively during challenging
            times. <br /><br />
            Additionally, my experience has provided me with valuable insights
            into advising digital and creative businesses, as well as
            implementing new market opportunities in the music industry. I am
            passionate about blending creativity and technical expertise to
            build engaging, user-centric web applications.<br /><br />
            As an experienced entrepreneur, strategic thinker, and front-end
            developer, I can help bring your start-up idea to life. Explore my
            work to see how I can contribute to your businessâ€™s growth.
